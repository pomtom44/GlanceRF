<!--
  This HTML is injected into each grid cell that uses this module.
  The cell div already has classes "grid-cell grid-cell-{id}" (e.g. grid-cell-example)
  added by the core. Put only the inner content here.

  Use classes with your module id + underscore prefix (e.g. example_label)
  so they don't clash with core or other modules. Reference these same
  classes in style.css and script.js.
-->
<div class="example_label">Example</div>
